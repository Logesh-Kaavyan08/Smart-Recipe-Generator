## üìñ About The Project

As a developer passionate about creating intuitive user experiences, I built the Smart Recipe Generator to help users find recipes based on the ingredients they already have. My goal was to build a full-stack application that was not only functional but also fast, responsive, and enjoyable to use.

This project features a **Next.js** frontend and a **Python (FastAPI)** backend, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns and a modern, decoupled architecture.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Dynamic and Intuitive Ingredient Search**
    * **Real-time Suggestions:** Get auto-complete suggestions as you type, powered by a debounced API call to prevent server overload.
    * **Tag-Based Interface:** Selected ingredients are added as interactive "tags" for a clear visual representation of your search query.

* **Advanced, Multi-Faceted Filtering System**
    * **Instant Results:** Refine your search instantly by Difficulty Level, Maximum Cooking Time, and multiple Dietary Restrictions (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free).
    * **Interactive Controls:** An interactive slider for cooking time provides a seamless user experience.

* **Polished User Experience with Framer Motion**
    * **Smooth Page Transitions:** Navigating between pages is seamless, with elegant fade and slide animations.
    * **Meaningful Micro-interactions:** UI elements like recipe cards and the filter panel animate into view, elevating the overall feel of the application.

* **Scalable, Dynamically Generated Recipe Pages**
    * **SEO-Friendly URLs:** Leveraging Next.js's dynamic routing, each recipe gets a unique, shareable, and SEO-friendly URL (e.g., `/recipe/chicken-tikka-masala`).
    * **Maintainable Code:** A single, reusable React component serves as the template for all recipe pages, making the architecture efficient and scalable.
